            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <ul>

                <li>Accessibility</li>
                <p>The most important thing in webpages is being accessible. That is why we first checked if it follows the web content accessibility guidlines.
                    For example our webpage does not rely on one colour and it keeps shows every single element clearly.
                    We also provide clear navigation mechanisms. Moreover, we tried to make the page as clear and simple as possible.
                </p>

                <li>Usability</li>
                <p>Usability is an important aspect to consider in any webpage, that's why we made sure that our one-page website also follows the usabilty guidelines.
                    Our page Shows the company logo in a reasonable size and noticeable location. It has an about us section. For easier user experience we have made a navigation bar 
                    with 3 buttons. These button allow the user to move directley to a specific section in the webpage without scrolling. We also used images and clips to illustrate our section.
                    We also wanted to give our users quick information in the form of lists.
                </p>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Accessibility highlights</h2>
            <p>As discussed between us, we find that the most relevant accessibility guidelines our page follows are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#guideline2.1">2.1 Keyboard accessible</a></li>
                <p>Our page is fully accessible using the keyboard. So without having a working mouse you can access all elements using keyboard keys like the tab or arrows buttons. In addition, no functionality is lost since due to our keyboard accessibility, the form can be also be used with solely the keyboard to submit and reset products in the database. The main focus of our website is the products, so when our form would not be keyboard accessible, the website would not work properly as we envisioned.</p>
                <li><a href="guideline2.4">2.4 The page is navigable</a></li>
                <p>Our website is provided by a fully working navigation bar. The user can use it to directly move to the most important sections or parts of our page regardless of what section you are in at that time. Therefore we think that it is one of guidelines our website adhires the most. </p>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Improvement plan</h2>
            <p>Any webpage needs continuous improvements, in order to make our page better we have made an improvement plan. This plan is made using our TAs feedback and the evaluation of the accessibility of our page according to the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.
                This way we can develop our website and make it look more professional and to provide a better user interface and experience.
                First we will make sure that we do not get any errors on W3C. And also we wanted to fix any issues or comments the TA mentioned. Moreover we want to make later further improvements.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make the navigation bar stick to the top of the page when scrolling, such that there is always a mechanism available to bypass blocks of content <a href="#guidline2.4.1">(Guidline 2.4.1 - Bypass Blocks).</a></li>
                <li>Make links in the navigation bar to every section of the page (not just home, about us and products).</li>
                <li>Make navigation bar more responsive.</li>
                <li>Only show the important details while printing the page</li>
                <li>Page breaks are better implemented</li>
            </ul>
           
        </div>

Every input field is also presented with a placeholder value which tells the user what kind of input is expected.</li>
                                <li>Time-Based Media: The webpage has a media file/video-only file present on the webpage. Nevertheless, this video is purely for visual design an does not have any meaning of the contents of the webpage. Therefore no text is accompanied with this video since it has not got any meaning.</li>
                                <li>Test: Guidline does not apply since, the webpage doesn't contain a test.</li>
                                <li>Sonsory: As stated in guidline 1.3.3 the webpage does not have any sensory characteristics, therefore the guidline does not apply.</li>
                                <li>CAPTCHA: Guidline does not apply since, the webpage doesn't contain a CAPTCHA.</li>
                                <li>Decoration, Formatting, Invisible: The webpage consists of a video in the 'about us' section which is pure decoration. The website fails this guidline since this video is not implemented in such a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology at the moment. </li>
